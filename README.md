# camel-x3

This Progressive Web App bridges the gap between the Amazon app and [CamelCamelCamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com/) using the [share sheet](https://web.dev/web-share/) on your phone. Installing this web app to your home screen also adds it in your share sheet, allowing to send the product you are looking for to CamelCamelCamel for pricing history. And bonus points: you can choose to open the website in Chrome or Firefox Focus!

[Go on, try it!](https://catdad-experiments.github.io/camel-x3/)
